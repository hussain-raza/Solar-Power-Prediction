# Solar Power Generation Forecasting

The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques, such as **Linear Regression, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor**, compare the evaluation metrics of the models and chose the best one to predict solar power generation based on the dataset. *By achieving accurate predictions, this project aims to assist in efficient energy management and facilitate the integration of solar power into the existing power grid.*
